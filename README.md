# egui_glium_pure_window_not_closing
 Small example of window not closing, run `cargo run` to see, you can comment out lines to see it work properly, but seems like they shouldn't be necessary

//"Explicit call to DestroyWindow() shouldn't be necessary but isn't closing otherwise");
// unsafe {
//     winuser::DestroyWindow(h_wnd);
// }
